    Frequent Questions
Why are you building this?
Political deadlock on the Bitcoin network, increasing risks of centralization and corporate control, access to an active smart contract development community for significantly enhancing the capabilities of a store of value.

Do I have to buy tokens?
No. There are numerous ways to acquire Bitcoineum, including user oriented mining. This is a completely fair mined crypto token, there is no initial distribution, no founder\'s reward, no pre-mine, no initial payments to the developers.

How do I mine?
Mining is essentially modelled as a game, similar to Satoshi Dice where you can risk Ether to increase your chance of receiving a block reward. This is a dynamic game where participants are betting against each other for a Bitcoineum reward. The testnet and main network versions of this game will be accessible from this Website via a web miner.

How does Bitcoineum store value?
Bitcoineum is digitally scarce in the same way that Bitcoin is, but benefits from Ethereum's smart contract capabilities and higher transactional throughput. The mining process mimics the physical process of expending electricity to guess a large random number in a certain format that Bitcoin employs.

Are you running an ICO?
No. Bitcoineum is a proof-of-burn currency, it is created through the destruction of other resources, this acts as a continual proxy of value.

What if nobody mines?
The difficulty of the network will drop until it becomes profitable for people to mine again, thus reaching equilibrium. Since the transactional throughput and integrity are managed by Ethereum large pauses in block creation are not problematic and only serve to increase the value for existing holders.

How will this be managed?
The intention is to make Bitcoineum completely autonomous in operation, with a small verifiable code base, and extensive security auditing. The entire code base will be open source and accessible prior to operation.

Why would I want this versus Bitcoin?
The Bitcoin network has it's own set of risks and limitations, centralized development and control, centralized mining, and changes in how the network will work could undermine it's utility as a store of value. It is easier to replicate Bitcoin's store of value semantics on Ethereum, than it is to replicate Ethereum's smart contract capabilities on Bitcoin.
